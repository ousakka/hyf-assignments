The clock hummed softly as the rain whispered against the window. A half-eaten apple sat beside an open notebook filled with sketches of impossible machines. Somewhere in the distance, a train sounded its horn — three long notes that felt like a memory trying to find its way home.

A blue umbrella drifted down the empty street like it had somewhere important to be. The pigeons held a silent council on the power line above, judging everyone below. Someone left a note on a park bench that just said, “Remember the sound of leaves in September.” Nobody knew what it meant, but somehow, everyone felt it was meant for them.

The toaster refused to cooperate this morning, claiming artistic differences with the bread. Meanwhile, a cat wearing philosophical expressions sat by the window, contemplating the metaphysics of pigeons. Somewhere in a drawer, an old key dreamed of unlocking something important, but couldn’t remember what. The air smelled faintly of possibility and forgotten cinnamon.
