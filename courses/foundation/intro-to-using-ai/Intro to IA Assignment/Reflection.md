## 1. Three new things I learned from AI
1. How to use event listeners in JavaScript to create dynamic and interactive behavior on a webpage.  
2. How to generate random numbers in JavaScript
3. How to write Markdown (.md) files

## 2. Tweaks I made to Copilot's suggestions
The CSS styling suggested by Copilot was not exactly how I wanted, so I made changes to adjust the layout, centering, and overall visual appearance. I also used Copilot to explain the JavaScript code step by step, including the theory behind each function, which helped me understand how and why the code works.

## 3. Copilot: Generator vs Learning Partner
Using Copilot is really helpful because it makes the coding process easier and can inspire creative ideas. However, relying on it to generate code automatically doesnâ€™t help you learn or be creative, as it can make you more passive. When you use Copilot as a learning partner, it becomes a powerful tool to quickly find information and generate examples that help you understand new concepts. It feels like having a teacher beside you at home, guiding you while you learn.

## 4. Risks of relying too much on AI
1. Becoming passive and losing the ability to brainstorm or solve coding problems independently.  
2. Failing to develop real developer skills due to a lack of hands-on coding practice.  
3. Relying completely on AI tools instead of building confidence and independence as a programmer.
