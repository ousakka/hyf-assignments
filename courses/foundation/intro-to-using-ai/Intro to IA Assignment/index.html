    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hi, my name is Oumaima. I'm passionate about web development and currently learning to build modern, responsive websites. 
        Iâ€™m always curious and motivated to discover new technologies, tools, and ideas that help me grow as a developer and a lifelong learner. 
        I believe that every project is an opportunity to improve, create, and make something meaningful.</p>
